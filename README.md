# Steps to replicate the project(Bhum-Backend)

- git clone `https://github.com/Sudhakar7J/Bhum-be`.
- `npm install` to install the necessary node_modules to your working directory.
- I have set the postgres database directly into `app.module.ts`.

## **Launch the backend implementation**

- Run Backend NestJS using `npm run start:dev` and wait till the server starts running.

## **Launch the frontend implementation**

- Refer `https://github.com/Sudhakar7J/Bhum-fend` for React implementation for Frontend.
- Run Frontend React app using `npm start` and it will launch the dev server at `http://localhost:3000/`
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
